        <h2>MY STORY</h2>
        <textarea placeholder="Type your comment here...">Growing up, math was never my strong suit.When I was in 2nd grade, I faced something that would shape my relationship with learning for years to come. My math teacher, in a moment of frustration, slapped me. As an introvert, I found it difficult to express my feelings and struggles. This incident left a lasting impact on me, making math feel like an insurmountable challenge and dampening my confidence.
        For years, I carried the weight of this experience. My early years in school were marred by a persistent struggle with math, which only deepened my feelings of inadequacy.
		However, when my family moved during my 7th grade, a significant change occurred. The new environment provided a fresh start, and I found myself gradually improving academically. Math, which had once been my greatest challenge, started to become a subject I enjoyed.By 9th grade, my newfound enthusiasm for math and a dream of studying at IIT led me to focus intensely on preparing for the JEE exam.
	    I achieved a score of over 90% in 10th grade, solidifying my passion for pursuing engineering. But when the COVID-19 lockdown hit, my plans were disrupted.Unable to take the JEE as scheduled, I decided to take a gap year to prepare.The pressure during this time was immense. I pushed myself to the limits, staying up late, sometimes for two days straight, and neglecting my health.
		My introverted nature made it challenging to seek help or express the stress I was experiencing. The strain affected my health, and despite my efforts, I didn’t perform as well as I had hoped on the JEE exam.The results offered me a spot in a lower-tier branch at a distant college, but myparents, concerned about the distance, enrolled me in a nearby private college with lower placement rates. 
		This felt like another setback, but I chose to see it as a learning opportunity rather than a failure.Through this journey, I learned the critical importance of mental health and self-care. I began to recognize that failure is a part of the process, not a reflection of my worth. Seeking support from mentors and finding healthier ways to manage stress became crucial. 
		Balancing my academic goals with self-care allowed me to regain my confidence and perspective. My story is one of resilience and growth. Despite the initial trauma and the challenges along the way, I’ve come to understand that true strength lies in overcoming adversity and prioritizing one’s mental well-being.
		I’ve learned that every challenge is an opportunity for growth and thatpersistence, combined with self-compassion, can lead to success.Today, I continue to pursue my dreams with a deeper appreciation for the journey and the lessons learned.
		My experiences have shaped me into someone who values resilience and understands that every setback is a chance to build strength and move forward.
