        <h2>MY STORY</h2>
        <textarea placeholder="Type your comment here...">My anxiety was so crippling that I could hardly leave the house. Every day felt like a mountain to climb. I finally decided to seek help and started cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). 
		Through CBT, I learned to challenge my irrational thoughts and gradually faced my fears. I remember starting with small goals like going for a walk or attending a small gathering. As I accomplished these, my confidence grew. Mindfulness practices like deep breathing also became a part of my daily routine. 
		Joining a support group was a game-changer; sharing my struggles with others who understood made me feel less alone. Today, while anxiety still pops up from time to time,
		I manage it much better. I’m now involved in advocacy, sharing my story to help others who might be struggling with similar issues.
		hey shared practical advice and provided emotional support that was crucial to my recovery. Today, although anxiety still surfaces occasionally, I handle it much more effectively. I now advocate for mental health awareness, sharing my story to inspire and support others who face similar challenges.\
		Seeing how far I’ve come fuels my passion for helping others find their path to recovery.
