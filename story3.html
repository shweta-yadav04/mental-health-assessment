        <h2>MY STORY</h2>
        <textarea placeholder="Type your comment here...">Growing up, I envisioned a future paved by the prestige and opportunities of a Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degree. 
		However, the reality of high fees stood as a formidable barrier to this dream. Faced with this obstacle, I had to adjust my path, opting instead for a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Mathematics. This shift, while initially disheartening, would set the stage for a journey filled with unexpected challenges and triumphs.
        During my BSc studies, I discovered a profound passion for coding. The complexities of algorithms and problem-solving fascinated me. I delved into competitive programming, making LeetCode and Codeforces my primary arenas. With relentless dedication, my skills sharpened, and my ratings climbed, garnering recognition within the coding community. 
		Each problem solved and ranking achieved was a testament to my growing expertise. Despite my progress and achievements in coding, the job market remained unyielding. 
		The absence of a BTech degree often overshadowed my coding skills. Each job rejection felt like a personal setback, a reminder of the degree I lacked. These repeated rejections led to mounting stress and periods of depression, casting a shadow over my achievements.
        In the midst of this struggle, my projects became my refuge. They were tangible proof of my skills and dedication. I poured my energy into creating applications, contributing to open-source projects, and building a robust portfolio.
		These projects were not just assignments but a testament to my abilities and commitment.
        The turning point came when a startup, looking beyond conventional qualifications, recognized my potential. 
		They valued my skills and the work I had done rather than the degree I was missing. The role wasnâ€™t the most glamorous, but it was an opportunity. It validated that my efforts had not been in vain and opened the door to further possibilities.
        Gradually, my career began to gain momentum. The startup experience became a stepping stone, allowing me to grow and prove myself in the industry. Each day, my resilience strengthened, and the rejections that once seemed like barriers now felt like lessons guiding me toward a brighter future.
