        <h2>MY STORY</h2>
        <textarea placeholder="Type your comment here...">Social phobia made every social interaction a daunting challenge. It affected my personal and professional life, leaving me feeling isolated.
		I began therapy focused on social skills training and gradual exposure to social situations. By starting with less intimidating interactions and working my way up, I slowly built confidence.
		Support from friends and family was vital, as their encouragement helped me push through my fears. Today, I’m more comfortable in social settings and actively share my experiences through public speaking and mentoring.
		My goal is to help others with social phobia feel less alone and more empowered. Seeing others overcome their fears and thrive is incredibly rewarding and reaffirms the progress I’ve made in my own life.
		Now, I actively share my experiences through public speaking and mentoring. My goal is to reach out to others struggling with social phobia, offering them hope and practical advice based on my own journey. Seeing others overcome their fears and find their voice is incredibly rewarding. It not only validates the progress I’ve made but also fuels my passion for helping others.
		My own experience has taught me that with persistence and support, overcoming social phobia is not just a distant dream but an achievable reality.
