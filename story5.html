        <h2>MY STORY</h2>
        <textarea placeholder="Type your comment here...">Bipolar disorder dramatically altered my life, thrusting me into a whirlwind of extreme mood swings that wreaked havoc on my relationships and work. One day, I’d be on a high, bursting with energy and optimism, and the next, 
		I’d be plunged into a deep depression, struggling to get out of bed. This instability not only affected my personal life but also made it difficult to maintain consistent performance at work.The turning point came when I found the right
		medication. It was a long and often frustrating process of trial and error, but once I found a medication that worked for me, it provided a crucial foundation for further recovery. My moods became more stable, which was a significant relief and
		allowed me to focus on other aspects of my recovery.Therapy played an essential role in my journey. Through sessions with my therapist, I gained a deeper understanding of my bipolar disorder and learned strategies to manage my symptoms
